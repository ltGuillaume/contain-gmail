# Gmail Container

**Prevents being logged on for Google services other than Gmail and Calendar**

Gmail Container is an add-on you can install on Firefox to prevent Google from logging you on for all its services: only Gmail and Calendar will be opened in a separate container, while other Google services will not.
This is a fork of https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook.
